CineNostalgia Blog — 10 Movies That Were Far Ahead of Their Time

Files:
- index.html : The blog article (self-contained, references images in /images/)
- images/ : 10 AI-style cinematic PNG images, one per movie
- Note: The images are AI-generated placeholders (created locally) and are safe for editorial use.
If you'd prefer official movie posters or actual stills, let me know and I can replace the images with fair-use-sourced posters (you must confirm you want that and accept fair-use terms).
